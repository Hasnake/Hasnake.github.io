  <h2>2.Relational concepts (15 to 20)%</h2>
                 <h3>What is Normalization</h3>
    <ul>
<li>It is the process of organizing data in a database.</li>
<li>It includes creating tables and establishing relationships between the tables</li>
<li>Process is used to help eliminate redundant data</li>
<li>Five normalization forms (NFs) </li>
<ol>
<li>1NF: Eliminate Repeating Groups</li>
<li>2NF: Eliminate Redundant Data</li>
<li>3NF: Eliminate Columns Not Dependent on Key</li>
<li>4NF: Isolate Independent Multiple Relationships</li>
<li>5NF: Isolate Semantically Related Multiple Relationships</li>
</ol>
    </ul>
                  <h3>What is Referential Integrity(RI)</h3>
    <ul>
<li>(RI) is a database concept used to ensure that the relationships between your database tables remains synchronized during data modifications.</li>
<li>RI can be used to ensure the data is clean, may be helpful in optimizing your database environment and can assist in early detection of errors.</li>
<li>A combination of PRIMARY KEY and FOREIGN KEY constraints can be used to help enforce referential integrity of your database.</li>
<li>In addition to a foreign key referencing a primary key constraint, a foreign key can also reference a UNIQUE constraint to help maintain referential integrity.</li>
<li>Triggers can also be used to enforce referential integrity, however being triggers require code they donâ€™t execute as quickly as table properties such as a primary key constraint.</li>
</ul>
                   <h3>Methods for enforcing referential integrity</h3>
<ul>
  <li>There are several methods available in SQL Server to help maintain database integrity:</li>
  <ol>
  <li><strong>Primary key constraint</strong>:an attribute or set of attributes used to uniquely identify each row </li>
  <li><strong>Foreign key constraint</strong>:a column or combination of columns used to establish a link between data in two tables</li>
  <li><strong>Unique constraint</strong>:allows you to enforce uniqueness in columns other than the primary key</li>
  <li><strong>Indexes</strong>:ensures the index key contains no duplicate values and that every row in the table or view is unique in someway</li>
  <li><strong>Triggers</strong>:complex T-SQL statements used to provide data integrity when table data modified</li>
  </ol>
<li>Any of these methods can be created as a composite key which is an index or constraint created using more than one column.</li>
<li>It may be necessary to use more than one column to create a unique value for each row in a table.</li>
</ul>
