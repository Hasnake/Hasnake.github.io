  <h2>1.Understanding core database concepts(20 to 25)%</h2>
                 <h3>What is DB</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A database (db) is an organized collection of data, typically stored in electronic format </li>
      <li>It allows you to input, manage, organize, and retrieve data quickly</li>
      <li>Traditional databases are organized by records (rows), fields (columns) stored in tables which are stored in the database files</li>
    </ul>
                  <h3>What is Table</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>A database table is a collection of rows and columns that is used to organize information about a single topic.</li>
    <li>Each row within a table corresponds to a single record and contains several attributes that describe the row. </li>
</ul>
                   <h3>What is A relational Database</h3>
<ul>
<li>A relational database is a collection of tables of data all of which are formally described and organized according to the relational model.</li>
<li>Each table must identify a column or group of columns, called the PRIMARY KEY, to uniquely identify each row </li>
</ul>
               <h3>Database Management System (DBMS)</h3>
               <ul>
<li>Database Management System (DBMS) is used by the users to access the data stored in database files.</li>
<li><strong>A DBMS is also used to perform  administrative tasks on the databases and objects contained within the database.</strong></li>
<li>DBMS is a collection of applications that allows users and other programs to capture and analyze data
<li>by providing additional functionality like reporting services to help you create, deploy, and manage reports for your organization.</li>
<li>A RDBMS is a software system designed to allow the definition, creation, querying, and updating of data stored in relational databases.</li>
<li>A few examples of RDBMS include; <strong>Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Access, and MySQL</strong></li>
   </ul>
               <h3>Database Server</h3>
               <ul>
   <li>Databases are stored on database servers which are dedicated physical or</li>
   <li>virtual servers that host the database files and provide high-level performance for users who are accessing the data.</li>
   <li>Database servers contain the DBMS used to manage the data and administer the SQL Server environment.</li>
   <li><strong>A database server can have one default instance and several named instances of SQL Server.</strong></li>
   <li>A SQL Server instance is a copy of the sqlservr.exe program that runs as a Windows operating system service.</li>
   <li>Often multiple database servers are deployed to provide high availability and improve performance.</li>
   <li><strong>SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is the GUI used to manage SQL Server, its databases, and the content contained within the databases</strong></li>

   </ul>
