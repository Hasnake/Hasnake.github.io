  <h2>5.SQL Server Administration Fundamentals(20 to 25)%</h2>
  <h3><u>SECURITY</u></h3>
           <h4>Database security</h4>
<li>Securing your database content is a critical part of a DBAs job.</li>
<li> The design, testing, and implementation of security is necessary to ensure that confidentiality is not compromised</li>
<li><strong>Securables</strong> are the server, database, and objects a database contains</li>
<li><strong>Principals</strong> are the individuals, groups, and processes granted access to SQL Server</li>
<li><strong>Permissions</strong> are granted to a principal for every SQL Server securable</li>

                <h4>Logins and accounts</h4>
<li>Three tiered approach to accessing content.
   <ol>
<li>SQL Server access:a <strong>login</strong> is a security principal that can be authenticated by a secure system to provide a user access to SQL Server</li>
<li>Database access: a <strong>database user</strong>is mapped to a SQL login and provides a user or group access to a database</li>
<li>Object access: <strong>permissions</strong> are applied at the object level to provide the appropriate access to the objects within the database</li>
   </ol>
               <h4>Server-level security</h4>
<li>Authentication is the act of verifying a user or system identity and allowing them to login using:</li>
        <ul>
<li>Windows Authentication </li>
<li>Windows user account </li>
<li>Windows security group</li>
<li>Mixed-Mode (Windows and SQL logins)</li>
<li>SQL Server:specific login </li>
<li>sa account (built-in SQL administrator)</li>
        </ul>
<li>Logins can be populated into the fixed server roles or in user-defined server roles</li>
                   <h4>Fixed server roles</h4>
<li>SQL Server includes several fixed server roles:</li>
                     <ul>
<li>Sysadmin:perform any activity on the server</li>
<li>Dbcreator:create, alter, drop, restore databases</li>
<li>Securityadmin:manage logins and their properties</li>
<li>You can also create user defined server roles  that have specific permissions applied to the roles</li>
                    </ul>
 <h3><u>SECURING SQL SERVER DATABASES and OBJECTS</u></h3>
 <h4>Database-level security</h4>
<li>A database user is a database level security principal that must be mapped to a login at the server level in order for the user to connect to the database</li>
<li>A login can be mapped to different databases as different users but can only be mapped as one user in each database</li>
<li>Database users can be populated into the fixed database roles or in a user-defined database role </li>
<li>All users are automatically members of the public database role and cannot be removed</li>
                  <h4>Fixed database roles</h4>
<li>SQL Server includes several fixed database roles</li>
<ul>
  <li>db_owner – perform all configuration activities</li>
  <li>db_datareader – read all data from all user tables</li>
  <li>db_datawriter – add, delete, or change data</li>
</ul>
<li>You can also create user-defined database roles that have specific permissions applied to the roles</li>
<h3><u>CREATING and ASSIGNING PERMISSIONS TO A LOGIN</u></h3>
<h4>Guest logon accounts</h4>
<li>The guest user account is included in every database and is used by any user who accesses the  database but does not have a user account within the database
The guest user account cannot be dropped but it can be disabled by revoking it’s connect permission
	REVOKE connect FROM guest</li>
  <h4>Managing object permissions</h4>
  <li>Permissions to an object can be managed by using the following commands
Grant - provides a level of access to the object Deny - overrides any grant permission
Revoke - removes the previously assigned permission, regardless of whether it was a deny or grant permission</li>
<h4>Object permissions</h4>
<li>Object permissions are the permissions that allow a user to perform actions on database objects (such as tables, stored procedures, and views):
SELECT
INSERT
UPDATE
DELETE
DRI (Data Referential Integrity)
EXECUTE (stored procedures)
</li>
<h3><u>DATABASE BACKUPS</u></h3>
<h4>Databases backups</h4>
<li>A database backup is performed so you can restore data if it is corrupted or lost
A user may accidentally delete a table requiring the DBA to restore the table to the point it was when the last backup was performed
Database backups can also be used to restore content on another SQL Server so you generate reports from that server </li>
<h4>Common types of backups</h4>
<li>Full backup - contains all the data in a specific database, or set of filegroups or files, and also the portion of the transaction log necessary to recover all the data
Differential backup - contains all the data that has changed since the differential base
Incremental backup (transaction log) - contains only the data that has changed since the last full or incremental backup
Other backup types</li>
<h4>Data base restore</h4>
<li>Restore scenarios include the following:
Complete database restore – restore full database backup
Differential restore – restore all changes contained in the differential backup
Transaction log restore – restores a transaction log backup</li>
